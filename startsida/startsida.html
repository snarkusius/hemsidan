                        Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
                        I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
                        She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
                        In the shape of an "L" on her forehead
                        Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
                        Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
                        Didn't make sense not to live for fun
                        Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
                        So much to do, so much to see
                        So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
                        You'll never know if you don't go
                        You'll never shine if you don't glow
                        Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
                        Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
                        And all that glitters is gold
                        Only shooting stars break the mold
                    </p>
